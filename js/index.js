//EXERCISE 1: The Fortune Teller
//Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself? 
//Store the following into variables: job title, geographic location, annual salary,
// company name. Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, making $N for Z."

//EXERCISE 2: The Age Calculator
//Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it! Store the current year in a variable. 
//Store their birth year in a variable. Calculate their age based on the stored values.
// Output them to the screen like so: "They are NN years old.", substituting the values.

//EXERCISE 3: The Lifetime Supply Calculator
//Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? 
//Wonder no more! Store your current age into a variable. Store a maximum age into a variable.
// Store an estimated amount per day (as a number). Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
// Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".

//EXERCISE 4: The Geometrizer
//Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here. Store a radius into a variable.
// Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
// Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

//EXERCISE 5: The Temperature Converter
//It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here. Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".  Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
